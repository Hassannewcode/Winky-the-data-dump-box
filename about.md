# Winky: The Absolute Data Singularity

**Protocol:** UNIVERSAL DUMP PORT  
**Mode:** PERMANENT ACTIVE LISTENING  
**Philosophy:** NO SIMULATION. ZERO FAKING. ALL DATA IS COMPATIBLE.

Winky is not a tool; it is the world's largest digital antenna. It does not simulate signals or mock inputs. It is a raw, live, and fully functional listener designed to ingest **REAL** data from **ANYONE**, **ANYTHING**, and **ANYWHERE**. 

If a system can emit a signal—be it a bit, a byte, or a massive database dump—Winky is compatible.

## The Universal Mandate
1. **Zero Faking:** We do not mock. We process actual raw bytes, binary streams, and live transmissions.
2. **Absolute Compatibility:** If it exists, Winky can listen to it. There are no "unsupported formats" in the sink.
3. **The Full Listener System:** Active multi-vector hooks across HTTP, Window Messaging, Clipboard, Broadcast Channels, Global JS Objects, and Physical File Streams.

## Total System Integration
Winky acts as the terminal sink for the entire stack. It is built for:
- **Frontend:** React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla JS, Chrome Extensions, Iframes, and Shadow DOMs.
- **Backend & Servers:** Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, C++, PHP, Java, Ruby, and Perl.
- **Services:** Webhooks, Cloud Functions, Cron Jobs, CI/CD Pipelines, and Microservices.
- **Hardware & IoT:** Microcontrollers, Industrial Sensors, Raspberry Pi, and Network Switches via HTTP bridges.
- **Operating Systems:** Direct injections from Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, and Kernel logs.

## The Ingestion Vectors
Winky transforms the browser environment into a high-fidelity receiver:
- **Deep Link Injection:** `https://winky.app/?payload=[ANY_DATA]`
- **Cross-Origin Bridge:** Live `window.postMessage` listener for inter-app communication.
- **Clipboard Intercept:** Real-time ingestion of system paste events.
- **Broadcast Frequency:** Listens on the `winky_channel` for inter-tab synchronization.
- **Physical Drop:** Binary-safe drag-and-drop processing for raw disk files.

## AI Cortex (Gemini 2.5)
Once data enters the singularity, the Neural Engine (Gemini 2.5 Flash) performs deep packet inspection:
- **Recursive Type Detection:** Identifying anything from Python bytecode to encrypted JWTs.
- **Entity Extraction:** Pulling meaning out of chaotic, unstructured dumps.
- **Security Assessment:** Instant heuristic risk analysis for every incoming signal.
